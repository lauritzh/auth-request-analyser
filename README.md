# AuRA - Auth. Request Analyser

This **cross-platform** extension for Chromium-based and Firefox browsers aims to support the analysis of single sign-on implementations, by offering semi-automated analysis and attack capabilities for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect 1.0 [Authorization/Authentication Requests](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.1).

* Detailed Analysis of request parameters:
  * *Observations*: Informational findings within the Auth. Request.

  * *Attacks*: Proposed further test cases, can be automatically executed with one click.
* Store and reload URL: Can be used as clipboard for one valid request, restore saved URL in case an error causes a redirect.
* Search history for Auth. Request and replay the request.
* Indicate with a batch if the currently visited page appears to be an Auth. Request.

In case you have a requirement for an additional functionality, feel free to open an issue. You are of course very welcome to directly send a pull request including a proposed implementation ðŸ™‚

## Installation
*Always keep in mind that browser extensions have broad access to sensitive data! Therefore, it is recommended to install this extension only to browsers that are solely used for security analysis or development purposes. One great example for this is [PortSwigger's Burp Suite embedded browser](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/functions/embedded-browser).*

It is highly recommended to use the latest stable release from [Chrome WebStore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clonpaankbndgnciijbiokgjeofjdpeg).

Alternatively, you may use the latest build published in this repository.

## Privacy
